# Digit Recognition (MNIST-Dataset) Project

## General Purpose
This project aims to build an interactive web application that allows users to draw handwritten digits and get predictions using a deep learning model. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The app uses Streamlit to provide an intuitive interface for users to draw digits and receive instant predictions.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy. By leveraging deep learning and a pre-trained model, the app provides real-time predictions and helps users understand how machine learning models can be applied to solve everyday problems.
